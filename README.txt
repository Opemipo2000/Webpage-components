To run my web application:

Install the app PyCharm into your system then in the command window install python3.
Within python3 in the command window, install the following libraries: numpy, pandas, json, flask, sqlite3 and bokeh.

Open the Opemipo_Individual_Project file with the app and run the file 'frontend.py',
then web page would load up in a web browser via the link http://127.0.0.1:5000/


To operate on the webpage:

    Click the submit button after changing the values in the input boxes with the labels conductivity,
    e-static, e-infinity, and tau. A fresh graph should appear after reloading the page.

    Another option is to select a tissue type from the select menu; to do so,
    first select the value and click submit to alter the values of the input fields;
    then, after the initial reload, click straight on the submit button to change the shape of the bot.


To change the shape of the graphs via hand manipulation:

    Use the "box select" icon on the graph user interface to select the complete curve;
    This can only be done with one curve at a time.
    Then, using the "Point Draw Tool" icon, drag the single line graph to the desired shape.
